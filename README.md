# About Soul22
My name is Soul22 :v:, and I am an independent blockchain security researcher.

- Currently, I am actively participating in audit contests on platforms like code4rena and sherlock.
- My goal is to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. 
- DM me if you would like to collaborate in audit contests.  :two_men_holding_hands:
